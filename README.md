## Study Strategy

### Recommended Timeline

**If you have AZ-900 and Azure experience (3-4 weeks):**

- Week 1: Identity, Governance, Storage
- Week 2: Compute, Networking basics
- Week 3: Advanced networking, Monitoring
- Week 4: Practice tests and weak areas

**If starting fresh (6-8 weeks):**

- Weeks 1-2: Fundamentals + hands-on exploration
- Weeks 3-4: Core topics (Identity, Storage, Compute)
- Weeks 5-6: Networking (takes time to sink in)
- Weeks 7-8: Monitoring, practice tests, review

### Study Approach

1. **Read:** Go through Microsoft Learn modules
2. **Watch:** Video courses for topics you find difficult
3. **Practice:** Do hands-on labs (THIS IS CRITICAL!)
4. **Test:** Take practice exams
5. **Review:** Focus on weak areas
6. **Repeat:** Especially for networking and RBAC

### Tips for Success

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Practice CLI and PowerShell commands daily
- Actually create resources in Azure (don't just read)
- Take notes on concepts you find confusing
- Join Azure communities (Reddit, Discord, Tech Community)
- Set up cost alerts on your Azure subscription
- Practice time management (90 seconds per question)
- Read questions carefully (especially "EXCEPT" and "NOT" questions)

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Just memorize answers to practice questions
- Skip hands-on practice
- Ignore PowerShell/CLI
- Leave expensive resources running ($$$ bills!)
- Schedule exam before taking practice tests
- Panic if you don't understand networking immediately (it takes time)
